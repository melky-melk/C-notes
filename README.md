# C-notes

notes ive taken during COMP2017 in USYD. Most of the notes are from the youtube channel and have simply been commented over https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeVault
some of the notes are ripped straight from the tutorial sheet answers off of the ed workspace and have also been commented over

the .md files you can find scattered around are notes i took during tutorials
